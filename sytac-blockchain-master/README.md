# Sytac Cryptocurrency

The cryptocurrency boom is back! Bitcoin price is skyrocketing. 
People are selling their houses to buy bitcoin.
ICO's are rampant on the internet. Real and Fake!
Sytac as a top technology company doesn't want to miss out on the action.

So we want you to build a simple blockhain for Sytac.
The coin name will be SYCO (pronounced "psycho")

1. [Blockchain Exercise](src/main/java/io/sytac/syco/Blockchain.java)

There are test classes to test the requirements of each of the exercises

1. [Blockchain Exercise Tests](src/test/java/io/sytac/syco/BlockchainTest.java)

###Hints
1. Feel free to choose a good hashing algorithm.
2. Feel free to add your own tests as well for missing edge cases
3. Your code will be run against our own tests, so ensure that you have adequate coverage.

###In order to run the automated tests we need a Gitlab CI configuration file.

Here is the sample one: [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml)

As the **master** branch won't have the code for the exercises implemented yet, it's better 
to disable the automated test in that branch.

To see the pipelines, go to -> CI/CD -> Pipelines from the menu.

There is a branch called -> **sample_implementation** with the results for the exercises.
